# Contributing to Mixer's Developer Documentation

Welcome, and thank you for your interest in contributing to our Documentation! Contributions of any size are welcome!

Contributing is easy, but we'd like you to follow some steps to ensure that you have the best possible time in helping us out.

## Before Contributing

As Mixer is part of Microsoft, you'll need to sign Microsoft Contributor Level Agreement. You can read more about this agreement [here](https://cla.opensource.microsoft.com/).

If you don't do this first then we'll be unable to merge your contribution onto our site.

## 1. Consider making an Issue First

If the contribution you have in mind is large or complex please make an issue first. Someone else might be working on the same item and we'd hate for you to duplicate work with someone else.

Once you've made this issue:
* The team will review it
* We'll let you know if anyone else is looking into this issue
* If no one is working on it, we'll assign you to the issue and let you know to feel free to start work.

You can now move on to actually contributing.

## 2. Get Setup

1. Our documentation is written in [Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/). So make sure your familiar with it before you begin.
2. [Fork](https://guides.github.com/activities/forking) the repository to your account. This let's you edit it. If you're within the Mixer team you can skip this step :)
3. Create a branch for you to work on. This keeps your changes organized.

## 3. Make your Changes

1. Find the page you want to change. You can read more about how the documentation is structured on our [Structure page](STRUCTURE.md)
1. Make your changes:
    1. You can do this by cloning the repository and editing locally. We reccomend VSCode for MarkDown Editing. Use `CTRL + K, V` to open a Markdown Preview.
    1. [Or directly in github](https://help.github.com/articles/editing-files-in-your-repository/)
1. Commit your changes, please use a descriptive commit message.

## 4. Make a Pull Request

2. Open a [Pull Request](https://github.com/mixer/developer-docs/compare)
3. If your Pull Request Addresses an open issue, please add a line in your PR's description that says Fixes: #123, where #123 is the number of the issue you're fixing.

Once you've filed the PR:
* Some automated checks may run to ensure that you've signed the Microsoft CLA and that your documentation does not break our site.
* Our team will use GitHub's review feature to review your PR.
* We may ask for changes, if so please edit your changes and then ask us for another review.
* If your PR gets accepted our team will merge it into the `master` branch. After this your documentation change will go live on the Site.
