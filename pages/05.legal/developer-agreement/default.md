**4.   Other Developer Requirements and Policies**
**4.1.  Mixer's Values.**
Mixer's goal is to bring streamers and viewers together around the world's
fastest and only truly interactive streaming platform. Mixer's values are
represented by experiences and features that help achieve this goal, and
specifically that put community first, respect End Users' desires and
preferences, and enhance community, interactivity and fun. All aspects of
your Application and your development for the Service should aspire to the
same goals and experiences.
**4.2.  Commercialization of Applications.**
Microsoft is open to various ways you may wish to commercialize your
Application, provided that your Application, and the manner in which you
commercialize it, are at all times consistent with Mixer's values and this
Agreement.
**4.3.  Data Use.**
Much of the data accessible from the Service is public and free to End
Users in order to help achieve Mixer's goals, and in a manner that is
consistent with its values. Your use of data accessible from Mixer, whether
on its own or in combination with other data accessible to you, must be at
all times consistent with Mixer's values, Microsoft Policies, and this
Agreement. In addition, you may not sell any data you collect from Mixer,
or any business analytics or insights you derive from such data, without
Microsoft's prior written approval. Microsoft will deem any attempt to sell
such data without Microsoft's prior written approval as a conflict with
Mixer's values. You agree to take reasonable measures to ensure the
security of Mixer data in your possession.
**4.4. Conflicts with Mixer's Values.**
If, in Microsoft's sole discretion, your Application, its
commercialization, or your use of data you access from Mixer conflicts with
Mixer's values, then Microsoft reserves the right to take any actions it
may deem appropriate under the circumstances. This may include, but is not
limited to: (a) contacting you to resolve concerns about your Application,
the manner of its commercialization, your use of data, etc., in which case
you agree to work with Microsoft in good faith to resolve these concerns,
(b) revoking your API Key, or (c) terminating this Agreement as provided in
Section 8. For the purpose of illustration only: if your Application
includes display ads for products that, in Microsoft's discretion, are not
appropriate for the Mixer community, then Microsoft may contact you to
request that you remove such ads from your Application.
**5.  Intellectual Property.**
**5.1.  Ownership.**
Intellectual property provided by one Party to the other Party in relation
to this Agreement will remain the sole and exclusive property of the

goodwill, rights, and benefits in Microsoft Marks or Developer Marks
arising from use under this Agreement will inure to Microsoft or Developer,
respectively.

any kind, except they may not disclose the source of Feedback to any third
party without consent of the Party providing it.
**5.3.  Licenses By Microsoft.**
If a specific license accompanies a specific Development Resource, then
that license applies to your use of that Development Resource. For any
Development Resource that is not accompanied by a specific license, then on

requirements in this Agreement, Microsoft grants you (a) a limited,
revocable, nonexclusive, royalty free, non-transferable, non-sublicensable

nonexclusive, royalty free, non-transferable, non-sublicensable license to
use any API for the sole purpose of developing, testing, distributing and
