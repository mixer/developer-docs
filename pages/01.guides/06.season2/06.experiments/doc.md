# Season 2 Experiments

With Season 2 and Embers released we've started work on what's next for Season 2. To this end we're looking at working on several smaller experiments throughout Mixer to test new features on a limited number of channels. These experiments are designed to trial a feature out and gather data and insights into what our users think. As you're browsing Mixer or looking at logs from your applications or bots you may see some new packets, endpoints and methods. This page is designed to answer some of your questions about these experiments.

## Active Experiments

We've currently got 2 experiments running on a limited number of channels:

1. Applause - Viewers can applaud each other's chat messages
2. Progression - Viewers level up by interacting on a channel.


## FAQ

### Can I Integrate with these Experiments?
These experiments could be temporary and might not make it to all channels on Mixer. We therefore advise that you don't integrate with them at this time.

### Can I poke around?
If you use a browser debugger or your application / bot's logs you might see details on new endpoints. The details of these are not final and are subject to change at any time.

### What do I do if I have further questions?

[Email Us](mailto:mixerdevinfo@microsoft.com) your question and we'll get back to you.

### Will these experiments turn into fully fledged features?
Stay tuned on the regular Mixer [blog](blog.mixer.com) for full feature announcements and details.
