# Season 2 Beta Features

With Season 2 and Embers released we've started work on what's next for Season 2. To this end we're looking at working on several smaller features throughout Mixer to test new features on a limited number of channels. These features are designed to trial a feature out and gather data and insights into what our users think. As you're browsing Mixer or looking at logs from your applications or bots you may see some new packets, endpoints and methods. This page is designed to answer some of your questions about these features.

## Active Beta Features

We've currently got 2 beta features running on a limited number of channels:

1. Applause - Viewers can applaud each other's chat messages
