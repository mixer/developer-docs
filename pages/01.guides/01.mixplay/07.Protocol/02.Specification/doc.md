Vocabulary
==========

In this specification, the “client” refers to the software running on an
end-user’s machine or a third party trusted or untrusted server,
consuming the interactive input.. The “server” refers to the software,
or mediator, running on Mixer’s servers. A “participant” refers to an
end user on the Mixer website or a Mixer app giving input through the
mediator. Participants are backed by static, persistent “users” on
Mixer; a participant is a Mixer user who is connected to Interactive.
“Sparks” are the virtual currency of Mixer. Participants may be charged
sparks for specific actions in Interactive.

The key words “MUST”, “MUST NOT”, “REQUIRED”, “SHALL”, “SHALL NOT”,
“SHOULD”, “SHOULD NOT”, “RECOMMENDED”, “MAY”, and “OPTIONAL” in this
document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC
2119](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2119.txt).

Server Interaction
==================

The client establishes a connection to the client over a websocket, as
described below. In this section we lay out the authorization process
and initial states that the client may be in. Each of these
qualifications are checked in the order that they’re presented; a
failure at a previous check will precede all subsequent checks.

-   When making a handshake to the server, the client MUST include an
    `Authorization` header containing an OAuth bearer token. Failing to
    pass an authorization or passing an invalid or expired expiration
    SHALL cause the server to close the websocket after a connection
    with a `4019` code. See [OAuth](#oauth) for more information.
-   Additionally, the client MUST include an `X-Interactive-Version`
    header corresponding to the number version ID that the
    integration runs. If the version ID is not found, or the user does
    not have the correct permission to play the game, the connection
    will be closed with a `4020` code. For example:
    `X-Interactive-Version: 478210`.
-   The client MAY include an `X-Interactive-Sharecode` header if it
    wishes to use an interactive integration which has been shared by
    its author.
-   Additionally, the client MUST include an `X-Protocol-Version` header
    corresponding to the interactive protocol version it speaks. If this
    server cannot provide the version, a `400 Bad Request` status code
    will be returned. The protocol version specified by this document is
    **`2.0`**.
-   If there is already an interactive connection running for the
    channel, the connection will be closed with a `4021` code.

When a connection is established to the server, the channel enters a
“staging” mode, and after the client signals that it’s ready it enters
interactive mode where clients are able to connect and controls appear
below the Mixer channel.. The channel remains in interactive mode until
the connection terminates. Authentication context is preserved
throughout the lifetime of the socket.

![Channel state diagram](./state-diagram.svg)

For clients unable to set headers when initializing a websocket
handshake the client MAY include them as query string parameters. Like
request headers, the keys SHALL be case-insensitive.

Endpoint Discovery
------------------

Mixer runs multiple servers in several locations, and will put servers
into and remove servers from rotation over time as updates and made and
demand shifts. Clients should call the endpoint
[<https://mixer.com/api/v1/interactive/hosts>](https://mixer.com/api/v1/interactive/hosts)
to retrieve a list of currently available servers. This returns a list
of servers ordered by several factors, including distance to the client
and load. A typical response might look like this:

```js
[
  {
    "address": "wss://tetris1.dal-09.mixer.com"
  },
  {
    "address": "wss://tetris2.sea-01.mixer.com"
  }
]
```

In general, clients should chose the first returned server, falling back
to others if they’re unable to connect or they lose connection.

OAuth
-----

Connections to Interactive must be authenticated using OAuth. Mixer
implements Bearer and Implicit grants as described in [RFC6749: The
OAuth 2.0 Authorization Framework](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749).
You can view further details and configuration on our [developer
website](https://dev.mixer.com/reference/oauth/index.html); you need to
request the `interactive:robot:self` permission in order to connect to
the interactive mediator.

An alternative flow is available to interactive applications to avoid
the need for opening, embedding browsers, or requiring keyboard input on
the client device:

1.  Register an OAuth application on the [Mixer Lab](http://mixer.com/lab). If you’re developing an integration which will run on users’ computers, you should not request a client secret.
1.  Call [POST /oauth/shortcode](/rest/index.html#oauth_shortcode_post) with your `client_id`, `client_secret` (if any) and space-delimited `scope` you want in the request body. This will typically look something like this:

    ```http
    POST /api/v1/oauth/shortcode HTTP/1.1
    Accept: application/json, */*
    Host: mixer.com

    {
        "client_id": "fooclient",
        "scope": "interactive:robot:self"
    }

    HTTP/1.1 200 OK
    Content-Type: application/json; charset=utf-8

    {
        "code": "8WPVHT",
        "expires_in": 120,
        "handle": "Lc7eBcB78d5gZmqHOajMH3QnmFPrxLGr"
    }
    ```

1.  Display the short six-digit `code` to the user and prompt them to enter it on [mixer.com/go](https://mixer.com/go).
1.  Continuously poll [GET /oauth/shortcode/check/{handle}](/rest/index.html#oauth_shortcode_check__handle__get). It will give you one of a few statuses back:

    -   `204 No Content` indicates we’re still waiting on the user to enter the code.
    -   `403 Forbidden` indicates the user denied your requested permissions.
    -   `404 Not Found` indicates that the handle is invalid or expired.
    -   `200 OK` is returned once the user has granted your application access. The response body will contain an `code`.

    A poll which results in a 200 response might look something like this:

    ```http
    GET /api/v1/oauth/shortcode/check/Lc7eBcB78d5gZ... HTTP/1.1
    Accept: application/json, */*
    Host: mixer.com

    HTTP/1.1 200 OK
    Content-Type: application/json; charset=utf-8

    {
        "code": "r2BTMKCZJJyIuoNE"
    }
    ```

1.  The client app should use this code as an OAuth Authorization Code which it can [exchange](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749#section-4.1.3) for access and refresh tokens. The `redirect_uri` in the exchange request is not required and will be ignored, but you must present a valid `client_id`. A request to exchange the tokens might look something like this:

    ```http
    POST /api/v1/oauth/token HTTP/1.1
    Accept: application/json, */*
    Content-Type: application/json
    Host: mixer.com

    {
        "client_id": "fooclient",
        "code": "r2BTMKCZJJyIuoNE",
        "grant_type": "authorization_code"
    }

    HTTP/1.1 200 OK
    Content-Type: application/json; charset=utf-8

    {
        "access_token": "pHktaORPcQGejnz48rJQdDWh1AJpevs \
            TWnvKrZW5z2HP3lgEqhp9gzje1YfblIO2",
        "expires_in": 21599,
        "refresh_token": "HzCZSviiueoWsfcT6kh6d4n7SHUnfK \
            cFTRIOyHkgykjaCSIT5ctTqUKNTXfWsxfg",
        "token_type": "Bearer"
    }
    ```

1.  The response will include an `access_token`, which you should send in the Authorization header when you connect to Interactive, prefixed with `Bearer` per standard OAuth behavior. In the above example, the client would then connect to Interactive and present the header `Authorization: Bearer pHktaORPcQGejnz48rJQdDWh1AJpevsTWnvKrZW5z2...`.

Wire Protocol
-------------

Interactive’s protocol is similar to the protocol used in Constellation,
which is similar to JSON-RPC with additional support for events, with
the exception that RPC calls may be bi-directional. Additionally,
multiple compression algorithms are supported and may be switched
on-demand by the client.

The protocol consists of JSON objects, or “packets”, sent via websocket
data frames. Each frame MUST contain exactly one JSON packet. There are
two packet types: `method` and`reply`. Packet fields which are unused in
a given context–empty objects `{}` in method parameters, for example–MAY
be set to either `null` or be omitted entirely.

All timestamps used in the protocol are millisecond-precision UTC unix
timestamps.

Method packets are sent in a way very similar to JSON-RPC. This is the
only packet the client may send to the server. A method may look like
the following:

```js
{
  "type": "method",
  "id": 123,
  "discard": false,
  "method": "divide",
  "seq": 42,
  "params": {
    "numerator": 16,
    "denominator": 4
  }
}
```

-   `type` is MUST be set to “method”
-   `method` MUST be the name of the method to call
-   `params` MUST be an object, not an array, of named arguments to pass
    into the method.
-   `id` MUST be any 32-bit unsigned integer. It’s included in the reply
    packet and used to correlate replies from the socket. You should
    ensure that each request has a unique id within your session.
-   `seq` MUST be a 32-bit signed integer incremented by the server on
    each packet that is sent. The client MUST include the last `seq`
    number it saw when sending information to Interactive. For more
    information about why this is, see the Synchronization\_ section.

    Attempting to use a floating point number or an integer outside of
    the 32-bit range MAY result in the number being truncated or
    overflowing, or MAY cause the client to reply with an error.
-   `discard` MAY be set to `true` if the server does not require a
    reply for the method call. The client MUST effect any state changes
    regardless of the value of `discard`. The client MAY respect the
    server’s request to discard the successful response, but MUST reply
    with an error if one does occur.

Reply packets are sent in response to method packets. Replies are always
sent in response to methods unless the socket closes before they may be
sent. Some reply packets may look like the following:

```js
{
  "type": "reply",
  "result": 4,
  "error": null,
  "seq": 42,
  "id": 123
}
```

```js
{
  "type": "reply",
  "result": null,
  "error": {
    "code": 4000,
    "message": "Cannot divide by zero.",
    "path": "denominator"
  },
  "seq": 42,
  "id": 124
}
```

-   `type` MUST be set to “reply”.
-   `id` MUST be set to the id passed in the corresponding `method`
    packet, except if an error occurs wherein a packet cannot be parsed
    as JSON (code `4000`), in which case the `id` MUST be set to `0`.
-   `result` SHALL be the unstructured result of the method. It SHOULD
    be `null` if an error occurs, but it MAY be null for
    successful replies.
-   `error` MUST be a JSON object if an error ocurred, or
    null otherwise. If present it MUST always contain a `code` (which is
    generally an integer between 4000 and 4999, inclusive, in accordance
    with application-level errors as defined in the
    websocket specification) and an associated plain text `message`.

    It MAY include the path to the property or properties which caused
    the error, when appropriate. This will be expressed in dot notation
    relative to the reply `params`. For example, the following object…

    ```js
    {
      "foo": 1,
      "bar": [
        2,
        { "baz": 3 }
      ]
    }
    ```

    Can be referenced with these paths:

        foo
        bar.0
        bar.1
        bar.1.baz

    ​ Note that if fatal errors occur as a result of a method call, a
    websocket close frame MUST be sent instead of a reply. The close
    frame’s code and associated message SHOULD be the same as that which
    otherwise would have been sent in `reply.error`.

Multiple messages MAY be concatenated together in a single websocket
frame as a JSON array:

```js
[
  {
    "type": "method",
    "id": 123,
    "method": "divide",
    "seq": 42,
    "params": {
      "numerator": 16,
      "denominator": 4
    }
  },
  {
    "type": "reply",
    "result": 4,
    "id": "123",
    "seq": 43,
    "error": null
  }
]
```

Compression
-----------

All communication between the client and server MUST be initialized with
the `none` compression scheme and plain text messages via the `none`
encoding MUST always be accepted by implementations. This requirement
exists so that if the client or server detects a degraded state

The current compression scheme can be changed with a call to the
`setCompression` method as described below. Common compression schemes
include the following:

### `none`

All implementations MUST include the `none` compression scheme and MUST
select it by default for new connections. In this scheme, JSON objects
MUST be sent in plain text down textual websocket data frames.

### `gzip`

Compresses data using the `gzip` algorithm. Messages MUST be sent in
binary websocket data frames and be prefixed with the uncompressed
data’s length as an unsigned [variable-length
integer](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/encoding#varints).
In pseudo-code:

```python
message = encode_varint(len(packet)) + deflate(packet)
```

The client and server MUST reuse the same gzip data stream to send
messages, flushing writers to end each frame (using `Z_SYNC_FLUSH`, if
using zlib). Likewise the readers in both the client and server should
treat incoming messages as sequential parts of the same data stream.

Sample code is available in the
[appendix](#sample-code-for-lz4-and-gzip-stream-compression).

### `lz4`

LZ4 compression may be chosen as an alternative to gzip, providing
significantly faster compression and decompression than zlib at the cost
of a poorer compression ratio. Implementation is similar to `gzip`.

Messages MUST be sent in binary websocket data frames and be prefixed
with the uncompressed data’s length as an unsigned [variable-length
integer](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/encoding#varints).
The client and server MUST reuse the same LZ4 data stream to send
messages, flushing writers to end each frame. Likewise the readers in
both the client and server should treat incoming messages as sequential
parts of the same data stream.

Sample code is available in the
[appendix](#sample-code-for-lz4-and-gzip-stream-compression).

Synchronization
===============

The state of users, controls, and scenes can be changed by both the
client and the mediator in response to aggregations via various update
calls. These updates have a `priority` value, and each packet set has a
`seq` property for ordering purposes. Whenever a property on a resource
is changed, it’s tagged with the requester’s priority and sequence
number.

Changes are applied via the [JSON Merge
Patch](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7386) algorithm, and when
properties changed they’re applied deeply in the object. That is,
changing a property `foo` from another primitive to an object or vise
versa will be considered a change on `foo` itself, but updating a deep
property in `foo` will only be considered a change on that deeply nested
property, not `foo` itself.

These tags are used for conflict control, providing a means to make
property updates deterministic when multiple consumers are updating
them. Take a set of changes $A$ and a new incoming set of changes $B$.
For every property that conflicts:

> -   If $B.sequenceNumber > A.sequenceNumber$, then apply $A$’s change;
> -   If $B.sequenceNumber < A.sequenceNumber$, then pick the change
>     with the greater priority value;
> -   If
>     $B.sequenceNumber = A.sequenceNumber \land B.priority \neq A.priority$,
>     then pick the change with the greater priority value;
> -   If
>     $B.sequenceNumber = A.sequenceNumber \land B.priority = A.priority$,
>     then pick $B$–effectively, favor what the client gives
>     us explicitly. In this scenario, a race is possible and the client
>     will either need to correct the data at run-time or the developer
>     will need to instrument their code with priority values such that
>     a race does not occur.

When priorities are not specified they MUST default to 0. This can
happen in custom controls and update methods the client calls which omit
an explicit priority, or when the controls are first created by the
server when the client connects.

For example, a full Button control object might look something like
this:

```js
{
  "controlID": "win_the_game_btn",
  "kind": "button",
  "text": "Win the Game",
  "cost": 0,
  "progress": 0.25,
  "disabled": false
}
```

In order to update the “disabled” state, the caller should execute a
method like:

```js
{
  "type": "method",
  "id": 123,
  "method": "updateControls",
  "seq": 42,
  "params": {
    "priority": 1,
    "sceneID": "my awesome scene",
    "controls": [
      {
        "controlID": "win_the_game_btn",
        "disabled": true
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

Methods
=======

This section uses icons beside each method name to denote who may
implement them. In general, methods outside of the “core” methods are
not required to be implemented by the client.

-   <span class="mixplay-method server"></span> indicates the Mixer server MUST implement the method.
-   <span class="mixplay-method client"></span> indicates the client software MUST implement the method.
-   <span class="mixplay-method server optional"></span> indicates the Mixer server MAY implement the method.
-   <span class="mixplay-method client optional"></span> indicates the client software MAY implement the method.

Core & Authentication
---------------------

### ready <span class="mixplay-method server"></span>

The client should call the `ready` method after initialization is
complete to signal to the mediator that it’s ready to have clients
connect and start interacting. It can optionally call the method later
with `isReady: false` to enter another initialization phase.

```js
{
  "type": "method",
  "id": 123,
  "method": "ready",
  "params": {
    "isReady": true
  },
  "discard": true
}
```

-   A successful reply:

    ```js
    {
      "type": "reply",
      "result": null,
      "error": null,
      "id": 123
    }
    ```

### setCompression <span class="mixplay-method server"></span> <span class="mixplay-method client"></span>

`setCompression` changes the compression algorithm used to encode
messages. The server’s response MUST be sent in the `text` scheme and,
if the change is successful, subsequent messages MUST be compressed in
the new scheme. If a call to `setCompression` results in the current
compression scheme being chosen, the server MUST reset any state
associated with the current scheme.

It takes a single string argument, `scheme`, which MUST be set to an
array of preferred schemes in order of preference, from greatest to
least preference:

```js
{
  "type": "method",
  "id": 123,
  "method": "setCompression",
  "params": {
    "scheme": ["lz4", "gzip"]
  }
}
```

-   A successful reply will contain the chosen scheme:

    ```js
    {
      "type": "reply",
      "result": {
        "scheme": "gzip"
      },
      "error": null,
      "id": 123
    }
    ```

    If no preferred common scheme is found, the server MUST fall back to
    the plain `text` scheme.

### onReady <span class="mixplay-method client optional"></span>

The server SHALL call this method when the “ready” state changes.

```js
{
  "type": "method",
  "id": 123,
  "method": "onReady",
  "params": {
    "isReady": true
  },
  "discard": true
}
```

### getTime <span class="mixplay-method server"></span>

The server SHALL respond to this method with its current time, given as
a milliseconds UTC unix timestamp. The client MAY expect this to be
reasonably accurate against NTP. It’s recommended that the client use
this for clock synchronization, particularly when running on devices
where the operating system’s clock may not be accurate.

```js
{
  "type": "method",
  "id": 123,
  "method": "getTime",
  "params": {}
}
```

-   A successful reply:

    ```js
    {
      "type": "reply",
      "result": {
        "time": 1480432198536,
      },
      "error": null,
      "id": 123
    }
    ```

### getMemoryStats <span class="mixplay-method server"></span>

In response to this method the server will return an object identical to
the `params` in `issueMemoryWarning`; a dump of information about the
memory cap and current allocations. The `totalBytes` MAY be zero in
cases where memory usage isn’t capped, namely when using a standalone
local build.

```js
{
  "type": "method",
  "id": 123,
  "method": "getMemoryStats",
  "params": {}
}
```

-   A successful reply:

    ```js
    {
      "type": "reply",
      "result": {
        "usedBytes": 1024,
        "totalBytes": 2048,
        "resources": [
          "id": "default",
          "ownBytes": 400,
          "cumulativeBytes": 1024,
          "resources": [/* recursive */]
        ]
      },
      "error": null,
      "id": 123
    }
    ```

### issueMemoryWarning <span class="mixplay-method client"></span>

The server SHALL call this method when the client reaches a prescribed
threshold in their memory limit. It will contain the number of bytes the
client has allocated out of the total number of bytes, in addition to a
breakdown of how much memory is allocated where for debugging purposes.
If the client crosses the memory limit their connection may be
terminated with a 4018 error code.

```js
{
  "type": "method",
  "id": 123,
  "method": "issueMemoryWarning",
  "discard": true,
  "params": {
    "usedBytes": 1024,
    "totalBytes": 2048,
    "resources": [
      "id": "default",
      "ownBytes": 400,
      "cumulativeBytes": 1024,
      "resources": [/* recursive */]
    ]
  }
}
```

### setBandwidthThrottle <span class="mixplay-method server"></span>

This method may be called on the server to set throttling for certain
server-to-client method calls, such as `giveInput`, which could become
problematic in very high-traffic scenarios. It implements a [leaky
bucket algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leaky_bucket); the
client specifies the total bucket capacity in bytes and its drain rate
in bytes per second. The `params` contains a map of method names to
their throttle rules. Throttling previously enabled on a method can be
disabled by setting it to null.

Additionally you may configure a global throttle by specifying `*`, this
will operate on all methods.

By default a global throttle is configured with the following settings:

> -   `capacity` - 332160 bytes (30 megabits)
> -   `drainRate` - 1310720 bytes (10 megabits)

```js
{
  "type": "method",
  "id": 123,
  "method": "setBandwidthThrottle",
  "discard": true,
  "params": {
    "giveInput": {
      "capacity": 10000000,
      "drainRate": 3000000
    },
    "onParticipantJoin": {
      "capacity": 0,
      "drainRate": 0
    },
    "onParticipantLeave": null
  }
}
```

-   A successful reply:

    ```js
    {
      "type": "reply",
      "result": null,
      "error": null,
      "id": 123
    }
    ```

### getThrottleState <span class="mixplay-method server"></span>

This method exposes statistics for the number of dropped and sent
packets as a result of throttling rules set up in setBandwidthThrottle.
It returns the number of sent packets (ones `inserted` into the bucket)
and the number of `rejected` packets.

```js
{
  "type": "method",
  "id": 123,
  "method": "getThrottleState",
  "params": null
}
```

-   A successful reply:

    ```js
    {
      "type": "reply",
      "result": {
        "giveInput": {
          "inserted": 354892,
          "rejected": 481
        },
        "onParticipantJoin": {
          "inserted": 0,
          "rejected": 5983
        }
        "*": {
          "inserted": 361356,
          "rejected": 0
        }
      },
      "error": null,
      "id": 123
    }
    ```

### hello <span class="mixplay-method client optional"></span>

The server SHALL call the `hello` method when the connection is
authenticated and fully established.

```js
{
  "type": "method",
  "id": 123,
  "method": "hello",
  "params": null,
  "discard": true
}
```

### updateWorld <span class="mixplay-method server"></span>

Updates the top-level world state of the session.

```js
{
  "type": "method",
  "id": 123,
  "method": "updateWorld",
  "params": {
    "priority": 0,
    "world": {
      "isOnGlobalCooldown": false,
      "everythingIsAwesome": true
    }
  }
}
```

-   A successful reply:

    ```js
    {
      "type": "reply",
      "result": {
        "scenes": [ /* an array of Scene objects */ ]
        "isOnGlobalCooldown": false,
        "everythingIsAwesome": true
      },
      "error": null,
      "id": 123
    }
    ```

### onWorldUpdate <span class="mixplay-method client optional"></span>

The server SHALL call this method when the top-level world state is
updated.

```js
{
  "type": "method",
  "id": 123,
  "method": "onWorldUpdate",
  "params": {
    "scenes": [/* an array of Scene objects */]
    /* additional user-defined properties */
  },
  "discard": true
}
```

Participants & Groups
---------------------

The Participant object returned from many methods in this section
contains the following properties. Like all resources, you can define
and set custom properties on the participants and groups. Settable
properties are tagged, see the [Synchronization](#synchronization)
section for further details.

-   `sessionID`, a unique string identifier for the user in
    this session. It’s used for all participant identification
    internally, and should be viewed as an opaque token.
-   `userID`, indicating the user ID on Mixer. This is an unsigned
    integer and does not vary.
-   `username`, the user’s name on on Mixer, as a UTF-8 string.
-   `level`, the user’s Mixer level, an unsigned integer.
-   `lastInputAt`, set to the unix milliseconds timestamp when the user
    last interacted with the controls.
-   `connectedAt`, the unix milliseconds timestamp when the
    user connected.
-   `disabled` (settable), a boolean set to true if the user’s input as
    been disabled.
-   `groupID` (settable), a string referencing the group the user
    belongs to.
-   `anonymous`, a boolean set to true if the user is not signed in.
    When true, userID will be 0.

```js
{
  "sessionID": "efe5e1d6-a870-4f77-b7e4-1cfaf30b097e",
  "userID": 146,
  "username": "connor",
  "level": 67,
  "lastInputAt": 1484763854277,
  "connectedAt": 1484763846242,
  "disabled": false,
  "groupID": "default",
  "anonymous": "false",
  "is_awesome": true // a custom property
  }
}
```

The user always belongs to a group, and is assigned to the magic
`default` group when they first join.

The server provides methods like `getAllParticipants` and `getGroups`
which return the state stored on the server. However, the client should
store this information and incrementally update it by tracking calls to
methods such as `onParticipantJoin`; round trip time to Mixer servers
will often be in the hundreds of milliseconds, a noticeable delay in
many situations. This is the reason that more focused methods, such as a
method to get only the group names, are not provided–the client should
maintain state such that that information can be pulled out of memory.

### getAllParticipants <span class="mixplay-method server"></span>

The server SHALL return all currently connected participants as a reply
to this method. This method returns up to 100 participants for each
request; participant join dates continuation tokens. Iterating over the
list in pseudo-code might look something like the following:

```python
def loop_over_all_spectators(fn):
  last_connected_time = 0
  while True:
    result = server.getAllParticipants({ 'from': last_connected_time })
    for s in result['participants']:
      fn(s)

    if not result['hasMore']:
      return

    last = result['participants'][len(result['participants']) - 1]
    last_connected_time = last['connectedAt']
```

An example request:

```js
{
  "type": "method",
  "id": 123,
  "method": "getAllParticipants",
  "params": {
    "from": 0
  }
}
```

-   A successful reply:

    ```js
    {
      "type": "reply",
      "result": {
        "participants": [ /* an array of Participant objects */ ],
        "total": 4912,
        "hasMore": true
      },
      "error": null,
      "id": 123
    }
    ```

### onParticipantJoin <span class="mixplay-method client optional"></span>

The server SHALL call this method when a participant joins the
integration. It SHALL also be sent to the participant who joined.

```js
{
  "type": "method",
  "id": 123,
  "method": "onParticipantJoin",
  "params": {
    "participants": [/* an array of Participant objects */]
  },
  "discard": true
}
```

### onParticipantLeave <span class="mixplay-method client optional"></span>

The server SHALL call this method when a participant leaves the
integration.

```js
{
  "type": "method",
  "id": 123,
  "method": "onParticipantLeave",
  "params": {
    "participants": [/* an array of Participant objects */]
  },
  "discard": true
}
```

### onParticipantUpdate <span class="mixplay-method client optional"></span>

The server SHALL call this method when of the participant’s state (for
example, its group) is updated. The server will also send this to the
updated participant.

```js
{
  "type": "method",
  "id": 123,
  "method": "onParticipantUpdate",
  "params": {
    "participants": [/* an array of Participant objects */]
  },
  "discard": true
}
```

### getActiveParticipants <span class="mixplay-method server"></span>

The server SHALL return all participants who gave input after the
specified threshold time, where the threshold is given as a unix
milliseconds timestamp, in ascending order by the time they last gave
input. It may return a limited set of results in the case when the list
of participants is large. In this case, the client should advance the
`threshold` value to the `lastInputAt` time of the last participant and
keep calling until `hasMore` is `false`. Bear in mind that you may
receive duplicate records for each participant.

Iterating over the list in pseudo-code might look something like the
following:

```python
def get_active_participants(threshold):
  output = []
  while True:
    result = server.getActiveParticipants({ 'threshold': threshold })
    for participant in result['participants']:
      if participant['id'] not in [s['id'] for s in output]:
        output.append(participant)

    if not result['hasMore']:
      return output

    last = result['participants'][len(result['participants']) - 1]
    threshold = last['lastInputAt']
```

```js
{
  "type": "method",
  "id": 123,
  "method": "getActiveParticipants",
  "params": {
    "threshold": 1480432203927
  }
}
```

        "hasMore": true
      },
      "error": null,
      "id": 123
    }
    ```

### getParticipantsByMixerID <span class="mixplay-method server"></span>

This method allows the client to retrieve participant objects using their Mixer ID. The server SHALL return a mapping of requested IDs to Participant objects. All requested IDs SHALL be present in the response, mapping either to a Participant object or ``null`` if no user with the specified ID is currently connected to the integration.

```js
{
  "type": "method",
  "id": 123,
  "method": "getParticipantsByMixerID",
  "params": {
    "userIDs": [123, 456]

### updateParticipants <span class="mixplay-method server"></span>

Bulk-updates participants objects. Each participant in the array MUST
contain the participant ID to update, along with zero or more properties
which should be updated. The server will respond with a list of updated
participants.

The patch SHALL either be applied for all participants and properties or
fail; in no case will the server apply only a subset of the updates. If
a participant is listed who is not connected to the integration, the
update to that participant will be ignored.

        "code": 4019,
        "message": "You cannot delete a default resource."
      },
      "id": 123
    }
    ```

### onGroupCreate <span class="mixplay-method client optional"></span>

The server SHALL call this method when a new group is created.

```js
{
  "type": "method",
  "id": 123,
  "method": "onGroupCreate",
  "params": {
    "groups": [/* an array of Group objects */]
  },
  "discard": true
}
```

### onGroupDelete <span class="mixplay-method client optional"></span>

The server SHALL call this method when a group is deleted.

```js
{
  "type": "method",
  "id": 123,
  "method": "onGroupDelete",
  "params": {
    "groupID": "deleted_group_id",
    "reassignGroupID": "reassigned_group_id",
  },
  "discard": true
}
```

### onGroupUpdate <span class="mixplay-method client optional"></span>

The server SHALL call this method when a group is updated. This SHALL
NOT be called when a participant within the group is updated, only when
an attribute of the group (e.g. a custom property or the `sceneID`) has
changed.

```js
{
  "type": "method",
  "id": 123,
  "method": "onGroupUpdate",
  "params": {
    "groups": [/* an array of Group objects */]
  },
  "discard": true
}
```

### broadcastEvent <span class="mixplay-method server"></span>

This method is provided to allow the game client to fire one-off events
to connected participants. The method takes a list of zero or more
scopes to fire the event into, and raw JSON data to emit. The possible
scopes are:

> -   `everyone` fires the event to all connected participants;
> -   `group:<ID>` fires the event to all participants in the group
>     identified by the `<ID>`;
> -   `scene:<ID>` fires the event to all participants in the scene
>     identified by the `<ID>`;
> -   `participant:<UUID>` fires the event to a single participant with
>     the sessionID of `<UUID>`.

For example, this method will broadcast the data `{"hello":"world!"}` to
everyone in the `default` group and participant
`4ae538ac-6718-45e7-b12f-d12813428983`:

```js
{
  "type": "method",
  "id": 123,
  "method": "broadcastEvent",
  "params": {
    "scope": [
      "group:default",
      "participant:4ae538ac-6718-45e7-b12f-d12813428983"
    ],
    "data": {
      "hello": "world!"
    }
  },
  "discard": true
}
```

In this case, participants would see a method call like:

```js
{
  "type": "method",
  "id": 123,
  "method": "event",
  "params": {
    "hello": "world!"
  },
  "discard": true
}
```

    ```js
    {
      "type": "reply",
      "result": null,
      "error": null,
      "id": 123
    }
    ```

-   An example server response given if the scope is invalid:

    ```js
    {
      "type": "reply",
      "result": null,
      "error": {
        "code": 4024,
        "message": "Invalid broadcast scope \"foo\"."
      },
      "id": 123
    }
    ```

Scene Setup
-----------

Although scenes and controls can be created via our interactive studio,
the game client also has full control over their display and can
manipulate them at runtime. Each control is identified uniquely by its
ID, a UTF-8 string. Like all resources, you can define and set custom
properties on the scenes in addition to those described here.

### Built-In Controls

The following are a list of built in controls, which can be serialized
as JSON into Control objects. Certain properties are static, intrinsic
properties of the control, and cannot be modified. These are marked as
as “not settable”. Like all resources, you can define and set custom
properties on the controls in addition to those described here.

-   Buttons
    -   `controlID: string` (not settable)

        A unique control ID.

    -   `kind: string` (not settable)

        Must be set to “button”.

    -   `keyCode: integer`

        A JavaScript keycode which participants use to trigger this
        button via their keyboard.

    -   `text: string`

        The text displayed on a button.

    -   `tooltip: string`

        The tooltip text displayed when the participant hovers over
        the button.

    -   `cost: integer`

        The cost in sparks involved in pressing a button. Setting this
        to a non-zero value will cause a transaction to be created when
        the button is pressed, and included in the data sent down to
        the client.

    -   `progress: float`

        Renders a process bar on the button. Should be given in the
        range `[0, 1]`, where `1` causes the bar to be completely full.

    -   `cooldown: integer`

        Triggers a cooldown that lasts until the provided
        unix timestamp.

    -   `disabled: bool`

        Disables the control.

    -   `gamepadButton: number`

        The gamepad button to bind this control to. Most controllers
        have some variation of this button mapping:

        > 0.  A
        > 1.  B
        > 2.  X
        > 3.  Y
        > 4.  Left bumper
        > 5.  Right bumper
        > 6.  Left trigger (button will fire when it’s half
        >     way depressed)
        > 7.  Right trigger (button will fire when it’s half
        >     way depressed)
        > 8.  Back
        > 9.  Start
        > 10. Left joystick press
        > 11. Right joystick press
        > 12. D-pad up
        > 13. D-pad down
        > 14. D-pad left
        > 15. D-pad right

    -   `Position[]: An array of position objects` Contains an array of
        position objects as described in Control Positioning.

-   Joysticks
    -   `controlID: string` (not settable)

        A unique control ID.

    -   `kind: string` (not settable)

        Must be set to “joystick”.

    -   `sampleRate: integer`

        Participant’s JoySticks use this to determine how often they
        should send a `move` event to the server.

    -   `angle: number`

        Displays a “halo” on screen at the angle specified. Should be
        given in the range `[0, 2π)`.

    -   `intensity: number`

        Changes the opacity of the half effect.

    -   `disabled: bool`

        Disables the control.

    -   `gamepadJoystick: number`

        The gamepad joystick to bind this control to. Most controllers
        have two joysticks, so `gamepadJoystick` should be set to 0 or
        1, or left undefined to not bind it.

    -   `Position[]: An array of position objects` Contains an array of
        position objects as described in Control Positioning.

### Control Positioning

Within scenes, controls are rendered by the Mixer Frontend on three
different grids depending on the screen resolution of the participant.
Each grid has a size: “small”, “medium”, or “large”. Based on the
participant’s screen resolution one of these grids is picked to be
displayed. If the participant resizes their screen, the frontend
controls will automatically adjust to the best grid for the new
resolution.

Measurements within a grid are created with a grid scale where 1 unit on
the grid is 12 pixels on the screen.

Each grid has a width and height according to this scale, and a minimum
width in pixels the participant’s device must have for this grid to be
used. Their configurations are as follows:

-   Large - Used on large displays.
    -   Width: 80
    -   Height: 20
    -   Minimum Width: 900px
-   Medium - Used on smaller displays and large tablets.
    -   Width: 45
    -   Height: 25
    -   Minimum Width: 540px
-   Small - Used on Mobile Phones.
    -   Width: 30
    -   Height: 40
    -   Minimum Width: 0px

To specify the location and size of a control on a grid, a position
object MUST be specified when creating a control dynamically. These are
stored in the `position` array of a control. A position SHOULD be
specified for each grid. The Interactive Studio can be used to
experiment with control positioning.

A position object has the following properties:

-   `size: string`

    The size of the grid this position object is for.

-   `width: number` The width of this control.
-   `height: number` The height of this control.
-   `x: number` The position of this control on the x axis of the grid.
-   `y: number` The position of this control on the y axis of the grid.

### createScenes <span class="mixplay-method server"></span>

Creates new scenes. The sceneIDs can be any valid UTF-8 sequence of
characters. You can optionally choose to provide an array of `controls`
to set on the scene initially rather than requiring further `addControl`
calls. The client MUST provide a fully-qualified control object in this
method. Either all scenes and controls will be created or an error will
be returned, the server SHALL NOT apply partial updates.

Input
-----

Input objects are polymorphic events that represent actions that a
participant is taking. Each input includes an `event` string, such as
`mousedown` on buttons, in addition to a short `control` object
describing which contain it occurred. There are several types of
built-in events which occur for the default controls, and custom
controls which you create can fire custom events as well. These are the
built-in event types:

-   `mousedown`

    Fired on a button when a participant presses their mouse on it. It
    contains a `button` property corresponding to the [JavaScript mouse
    button](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/MouseEvent/button)
    that the participant used to click on the button. For touch events
    or input given on game consoles, the button will always be `0`.

    Additionally, if the button has an associated cost, a
    [Transaction](#spark-transactions) will be created and associated in
    the `transactionID` property of the params. For example:

    ```js
    "params": {
      "participantID": "b2f65dea-429f-4105-a280-745fd5d75945",
      "transactionID": "d69f689e-d4e6-42a4-8d9e-515772f9238f",
      "input": {
        "controlID": "win_the_game_btn",
        "event": "mousedown",
        "button": 0
      }
    }
    ```

-   `mouseup`

    Fired on a button when a participant releases their mouse. This is
    identical to `mousedown`, but it will not contain a Transaction;
    sparks may only be deducted on `mousedown` and `keydown` events.

    ```js
    "params": {
      "participantID": "b2f65dea-429f-4105-a280-745fd5d75945",
      "input": {
        "controlID": "win_the_game_btn",
        "event": "mouseup",
        "button": 0
      }
    }
    ```

-   `keydown`

    Fired on a button when a participant presses the key associated with
    the button’s `keyCode`.

    Additionally, if the button has an associated cost, a
    [Transaction](#spark-transactions) will be created and associated in
    the `transactionID` property of the params. For example:

    ```js
    "params": {
      "participantID": "b2f65dea-429f-4105-a280-745fd5d75945",
      "transactionID": "d69f689e-d4e6-42a4-8d9e-515772f9238f",
      "input": {
        "controlID": "win_the_game_btn",
        "event": "keydown"
      }
    }
    ```

-   `keyup`

    Fired on a button when a participant releases the key associated
    with the button’s `keyCode`. It will not contain a Transaction;
    sparks may only be deducted on `mousedown` and `keydown` events.

    ```js
    "params": {
      "participantID": "b2f65dea-429f-4105-a280-745fd5d75945",
      "input": {
        "controlID": "win_the_game_btn",
        "event": "keyup"
      }
    }
    ```

-   `move`

    Fired on joysticks when the participant moves the joystick. This is
    *not* sent continuously if the joystick is not moving, and is
    throttled so that no more than one event can be fired per used every
    50 milliseconds (by default). It contains the `x` and `y`
    coordinates at which the joystick is positioned, where `[-1, -1]` is
    the upper left corner and `[1, 1]` is the lower right corner. Their
    magnitude will be $\left|[x, y]\right| \leq 1$.

    ```js
    "params": {
      "participantID": "b2f65dea-429f-4105-a280-745fd5d75945",
      "input": {
        "controlID": "move_participant",
        "event": "move",
        "x": 0.64,
        "y": -0.1
      }
    }
    ```

### giveInput <span class="mixplay-method client"></span>

`giveInput` is called on the client in firehose mode when a participant
gives input. It contains the participant that gave the input and a list
of input objects they provided. This method is not called until after
the input is validated and will not be called for disabled participants.

```js
{
  "type": "method",
  "id": 123,
  "method": "giveInput",
  "discard": true,
  "params": {
    "participantID": "b2f65dea-429f-4105-a280-745fd5d75945",
    "input": { /* an Input object */ }
  }
}
```

-   A successful reply:

    ```js
    {
      "type": "reply",
      "result": null,
      "error": null,
      "id": 123
    }
    ```

Spark Transactions
------------------

Some actions, such as clicking a button with an associated code, can
generate spark transactions. Each transaction is assigned a unique
integer ID. These transactions work similarly to credit card
transactions:

-   The server creates “charges” in response to spark associated actions
-   The charge is initially “uncaptured”
-   You can “capture” the charge to submit it and deduct sparks.

Charges are expired five minutes after they’re created.

### capture <span class="mixplay-method server"></span>

Calling capture SHALL cause the server to attempt to deduct a spark
transaction from the participant. The server makes a best-effort to
validate the charge before it’s created, blocking obviously invalid ones
outright, but when possible the client SHOULD await a successful reply
before effecting any associated action.

```js
{
  "type": "method",
  "id": 123,
  "method": "capture",
  "params": {
    "transactionID": 1
  }
}
```

-   A successful reply:

    ```js
    {
      "type": "reply",
      "result": null,
      "error": null,
      "id": 123
    }
    ```

-   Unsuccessful replies:

    ```js
    {
      "type": "reply",
      "result": null,
      "error": {
        "code": 4006,
        "message": "Unknown or expired transaction ID.",
        "path": "transactionID"
      },
      "id": 123
    }
    ```

    ```js
    {
      "type": "reply",
      "result": null,
      "error": {
        "code": 4007,
        "message": "The participant doesn't have enough sparks."
      },
      "id": 123
    }
    ```

File Storage
------------

With the advent of Custom Controls, the Interactive service provides
secure session-bound storage for files. Total file size is limited and
the storage is cleared immediately when the game client disconnects.

### uploadFile <span class="mixplay-method server"></span>

Authorizes a file upload. The client MUST call this method with a
relative `path` the file should be stored at, and the server MUST with a
fully qualified URL where the file upload can be made and a token to be
provided in the `Authorization` header of the upload.

```js
{
  "type": "method",
  "id": 123,
  "method": "uploadFile",
  "params": {
    "path": "images/map-tile-001.jpg"
  }
}
```

-   A successful reply:

    ```js
    {
      "type": "reply",
      "result": {
        "url": "https://example.com/yoGPaWs95WuY1wHr/images/map-tile-001.jpg",
        "authorization": "pQsWjRFrdgj06EWF"
      },
      "error": null,
      "id": 123
    }
    ```

    To see how to upload a file, see the [Upload
    Endpoint](#upload-endpoint) section.

### deleteFile <span class="mixplay-method server"></span>

Removes a previously uploaded file from storage. If the file does not
exist, the server SHALL NOT return an error. The server SHALL remove the
file’s size from the client’s storage quota.

```js
{
  "type": "method",
  "id": 123,
  "method": "deleteFile",
  "params": {
    "path": "images/map-tile-001.jpg"
  }
}
```

-   A successful reply:

    ```js
    {
      "type": "reply",
      "result": null,
      "error": null,
      "id": 123
    }
    ```

### Upload Endpoint

In order to upload the contents of a file previously requested in the
`uploadFile` method, the client MAY may a `POST` request to the return
URL and MUST include the returned token in the `Authorization` header as
well as an appropriate `Content-Length` header. For example, to upload
the map tile given in uploadFile’s example, one might use the following
cURL command:

```bash
cat map-tile-001.jpg | \
  curl -XPOST https://example.com/yoGPaWs95WuY1wHr/images/map-tile-001.jpg \
  -H Authorization:pQsWjRFrdgj06EWF
```

The server MAY choose to accept alternative content encodings, such as
`gzip` and `lz4`. If the client chooses to use one of these encoding, it
MUST include an appropriate `Content-Encoding` header and an
`X-Total-Length` header which includes the size of the uncompressed
payload. If we wanted to upload a gzipped version of the map tile above,
we could do something like this:

```bash
cat map-tile-001.jpg | gzip | \
  curl -XPOST https://example.com/yoGPaWs95WuY1wHr/images/map-tile-001.jpg \
  -H Authorization:pQsWjRFrdgj06EWF \
  -H Content-Encoding:gzip \
  -H X-Total-Length:`cat map-tile-001.jpg | wc -c`
```

The server SHALL return:

> -   `400 Bad Request` response if an `Content-Length` header is not
>     provided, an `X-Total-Length` header where the `Content-Encoding`
>     is included an not an empty string or `identity`, or an
>     unsupported `Content-Encoding` is provided;
> -   `403 Forbidden` response if the client is not authorized to upload
>     a file to the requested location;
> -   `413 Payload Too Large` if the client’s storage quota is smaller
>     than the file size;
> -   `200 OK` otherwise.
