# Auth

Authenticate as an active user in a specified channel. Arguments are `channelId`, `userId`, `key`. You can connect anonymously by supplying just the `channnelId` as an argument, but if you do this you will not be able to send messages or participate in chat. This can be useful for creating chat overlays.

# Arguments

1. The **channel ID** of the channel you are joining.
1. The **user ID** of the user you are connecting as. This can be omitted if you are connecting anonymously.
1. The **authorization key** retrieved from a request to our REST API, as explained in the [Connection](/reference/chat/connection) section. This can be omitted if you are connecting anonymously.
1. The **test stream access key** used to join the channel. This final argument is completely optional, and should only be provided if you wish to join a channel actively in a Test Stream.
